FROG AND FUZZ (FNF)

We are two students from Telecom SudParis and this is our final year project based on the driller module for AFL devloped by the Shellphish team.

We aim to create a similar module for honggfuzz capable of finding new basic blocks whenever hongfuzz fails thanks to symbolic execution using the angr framework.

This project is very new hence there is still no documentation. Feel free to help/fork or ask us any questions through email.
